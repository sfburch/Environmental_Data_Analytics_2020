## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>
The purpose of this repository is to have a place to overlay and compare CH4 emissions from enteric fermentation in the United States across different ruminant livestock species. guideline and what type of data it contains; will need to rbind overlaps in column names; goals of analysis. research questions to be addressed:

## Keywords

<add relevant keywords here>
CH4; methane; agriculture; GHG emissions; emissions; ruminant; enteric fermentation; cattle

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>
All data was accessed in April 2020 and has been downloaded from FAOSTAT on Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, which "provides free access to food and agriculture data for over 245 countries and territories and covers all FAO regional groupings 
from 1961 to the most recent year available." Additional information regarding the dataset: "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from enteric fermentation consist of methane gas produced in digestive systems of ruminants and to a lesser extent of non-ruminants. The FAOSTAT emissions database is computed following Tier 1 IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories vol. 4, ch. 10 and 11 (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html)."

Could connect to:???? The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimated by FAO and may not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international reference
